#My Reads Project

A bookshelf app that allows the user to search for, select, and categorize books that they have read, are currently reading, or want to read in the future. 

##Pre-requisites
This app requires only [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

##Get the App
Download the app from [https://github.com/jacobblaylock/udacity-reactnd-my-reads](https://github.com/jacobblaylock/udacity-reactnd-my-reads) or clone it into a new git repository:
` git clone https://github.com/jacobblaylock/udacity-reactnd-my-reads `

##Install
Navigate to the root of the project directory and run the following commands:

```
    npm install
    npm start
```

This should automatically launch the app in your browser, but if it does not, navigate to localhost:3000 in your favorite browser.
